ABChess
=====

Chess programm in C# just for my private fun in an early state! The code is seperated into a engine DLL and a GUI for that engine. If you want to play Chess in a hot seat mode only take a look at the first release.

Makes use of BitMaps.Currently Windows only later maybe using Mono. In the end it will include an AI and a internet multiplayer option. In case of any questions please contact me via mail c.muehle18@googlemail.com.

Have fun :)
