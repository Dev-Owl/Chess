ABChess
=====

Chess programm in C# just for my private fun in an early state! The code is seperated into a engine DLL and a GUI for that engine.

Makes use of BitMaps and a MonogDB backend.Currently Windows only. In the end it will include an AI and a internet multiplayer option. In case of any questions please contact me via mail c.muehle18@googlemail.com.

Have fun :)
